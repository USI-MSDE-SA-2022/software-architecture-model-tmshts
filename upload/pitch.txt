Project name: Quiz

Project type:
I have been working on this project as a working student at my home university.

Vision statement:
For universities who provide additional learning possibility for their students.

The quiz is an educational application that enables to the students to create an own quiz. This quiz can be then shared among other classmates. But not just this, the application also gives an opportunity to practise the students skills gained in the classes by answering the quiz created by someone else (professor or classmates).

Main benefit is that the application can be downloaded on the SmartPhones and so the students are able to create their own quizes or answer the questions on the way.

Additional Information:
Gratitude and credit to my supervisor Christian Fleiner.
