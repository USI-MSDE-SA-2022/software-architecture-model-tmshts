<p>Developing an app natively for each OS is expensive and time consuming, but it benefits from a good performance. Choosing a cross-platform environment on the other hand simplify the development process, making it faster and cheaper, but it might suffer in performance.</p>
<h2 id="complexity-vs-composability">Complexity vs. Composability</h2>
<p>Software can be very complex due to huge amount of connections between the components. More complex the software is, the less easy is to assemble all the components. In other words, it is difficult to have high complexity and composability.</p>
<h2 id="complexity-vs-clarity">Complexity vs. Clarity</h2>
<p>The complex software can loose the clarity of the software. The software with high complexity, will bring less clarity. In other words, it may be very difficult to understand the complex software.</p>
<h2 id="time-to-market-vs-usability">Time to Market vs. Usability</h2>
<p>Management wishes to launch a software product ASAP. Due to lack of time, the software is not as designed as needed. This may cause a negative effect of usability of the product. Development department is in hurry to deliver a product and so the usability factor is omitted. In other words, it may be impossible to deliver product on the market ASAP with very high usability.</p>
<h2 id="interoperability-vs-performance">Interoperability vs. Performance</h2>
<p>Interoperability is great quality attribute of a software. Our software product can exchange information with various different computer systems. On the other hand, the performance of our software product decreases due to this  high degree of exchange.</p>

<li><p>(1) Should we find cases where two components cannot communicate (and are doing it wrongly) and highlight they would need an adapter?, or cases where we have already a &quot;component playing the role of adapter in the view&quot; and highlight only the adapter?</p>
<p><em>Both are fine. We assumed that if you draw a dependency (or a connector) the interfaces match, but if you detect that the components that should communicate cannot communicate then of course introduce an adapter to solve the mismatch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>(2) Please show the details about the two interfaces which do not match (e.g., names of parameters, object structures) so that it becomes clear why an adapter is needed and what the adapter should do to bridge the mismatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>(5-6) These questions are about the implications on coupling based on the decisions you documented in the connector view.
Whenever you have a connector you couple together the components and different connectors will have different forms of coupling</p>
<p>For example, if you use calls everywhere, do you really need them everywhere? is there some pair of components where you could use a message queue instead?</p>
<p>Regarding the coupling facets mentioned in question 5. You do not have to answer all questions related to &quot;discovery&quot;, &quot;session&quot;, &quot;binding&quot;, &quot;interaction&quot;, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; (p.441, Coupling Facets).

<p>In order to create a mismatch in my logical view, I replaced mySQL database with PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is a perfect match for Java. However, I code in Python.

<p>Web API is a kind of bridge between the external component (Trading platforms) and the Trading Aggregator (controller).

How can you improve your architectural model to minimize coupling between components? (Include a revised logical/connector view with your solution)</h2>
<h3 id="connector-view">Connector view</h3>
<p><img src="./c5_3.svg" alt="Example Connector View Diagram"></p>
<p>I am not aware of the fact that I can improve my architectural model to minimize coupling between components for the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remote Procedure Call (synchronous call) between User Interface and Trading Agreggator must remain as User Interface is blocked until the call is responded.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Message bus between Trading Platforms and Trading Aggregator must remain because of subscription for news - less coupled than in case of Remote Procedure Call which is great - ASYNC AVAILABILITY</p>
</li>
<li><p>Web API between Trading Aggregator and Gmail Handler, Exchange Rate and Trading Platforms must remain because of HTTP requests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Asynchronous call between Trading Aggregator and Schedule and Graph visualization since Trading Aggregator can not be blocked for the time waiting for response. Less coupled than in case of Remote Procedure Call.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ex---physical-and-deployment-views"><span class='task'>12.</span>  Physical and Deployment Views</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>a. Extend your architectural model with the following viewpoints:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Physical or Container View</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deployment View</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your model should be non-trivial: include more than one physical device/virtual container (or both). Be ready to discuss which connectors are found at the device/container boundaries.</p>
<p>b. Write an ADR about which deployment strategy you plan to adopt. The alternatives to be considered are: big bang, blue/green, shadow, pilot, gradual phase-in, canary, A/B testing.</p>
<p>c. (Optional) Prepare a demo of a basic continuous integration and delivery pipeline for your architectural documentation so that you can obtain a single, integrated PDF with all the viewpoints you have modeled so far.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>configure a GitHub webhook to be called whenever you push changes to your documentation</li>
<li>setup a GitHub action (or similar) to build and publish your documentation on a website</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>What did you decide?</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to launch the product on the market I need a deployment strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What was the context for your decision?</p>
<ul>
<li>The point is that we do not have any version on the market. In other words, we launch our first version of TradAgg on the market.
  Our goal is not to make bad reputation for the entire market. Therefore, we only want to touch a market with few users (friends, acquaintances, fake profiles, etc.) for a limited time. Thus, we will get a feedback from the users and consequently we can make some changes in our software.
  After making some changes, we use the Gradual Phase-In on real users. In this case, we can check the feedback from users and if everything goes according to a plan, we can bring more users, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What is the scope of your decision? Does it affect the entire architecture?</p>
<ul>
<li>If some issue appears, it may affect the entire backend or frotend depending on the scope of issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</p>
<ul>
<li>The best strategy how to deploy my TradAgg application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Which alternative options did you consider?
  List at least 3 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot</li>
<li>Gradual Phase-in</li>
<li>Canary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Which one did you choose?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What is the main reason for that?</p>
<h4 id="advantages-8">Advantages:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Meticulousness - double-check</li>
<li>Avoid bad reputation</li>
<li>Quick feedback from fake users</li>
<li>Real users untouched</li>
<li>Time to work on buggs</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disadvantages-1">Disadvantages:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Longer time to launch a product for real users</li>

<section class="instructions"><p>The goal of this week is to plan how to deliver your software as a service with high availability.</p>
<ol>
<li>If necessary, change your deployment design so that your software is hosted on a server (which could be running as a Cloud VM). Your SaaS architecture should show how your SaaS can be remotely accessed from a client such as a Web browser, or a mobile app</li>
<li>Sketch your software as a service pricing model (optional)</li>
<li>How would you define the availability requirements in your project domain? For example, what would be your expectation for the duration of planned/unplanned downtimes or the longest response time tolerated by your clients?</li>
<li>Which strategy do you adopt to monitor your service&#39;s availability? Extend your architecture with a watchdog or a heartbeat monitor and motivate your choice with an ADR.</li>
<li>What happens when a stateless component goes down? model a sequence diagram to show what needs to happen to recover one of your critical stateless components</li>
<li>How do you plan to recover stateful components? write an ADR about your choice of replication strategy and whether you prefer consistency vs. availability. Also, consider whether event sourcing would help in your context.</li>
<li>How do you plan to avoid cascading failures? Be ready to discuss how the connectors (modeled in your connector view) impact the reliability of your architecture.</li>
<li>How did you mitigate the impact of your external dependencies being not available? (if applicable)</li>

<section class="instructions"><p>Now that your architecture delivers your software as a service, let&#39;s redesign it so that it can scale!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick one scalability dimension: number of clients, size of input, size of state, number of dependencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>How well does your architecture scale along the chosen dimension? Where do you expect the bottleneck to be?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modify your architecture to remove the scalability bottleneck you have identified (show both logical, process and deployment view) - consider whether the API/interface of the bottleneck component should be improved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the scalability pattern you have introduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the issue of component discovery, choosing one of the alternatives: dependency injection vs. directory. Can you identify an existing component playing the role of directory/dependency injection container? Could you give an example of where you would need to add such component to facilitate dynamic component discovery?</p>

<section class="instructions"><p>Only dead software stops changing. You just received a message from your customer, they have an idea. Is your architecture ready for it?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a new use case scenario. Precisely, what exactly do you need to change of your existing architecture so that it can be supported? Model the updated logical/process/deployment views.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pick another use case scenario so that it can be supported without any major architectural change (i.e., while you cannot add new components, it is possible to extend the interface of existing ones or introduce new dependencies). Illustrate with a process view, how your previous design can satisfy the new requirement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change impact. One of your externally sourced component/Web service API has announced it will introduce a breaking change. What is the impact of such change? How can you control and limit the impact of such change? Update your logical view</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open up your architecture so that it can be extended with plugins by its end-users. Where would be a good extension point? Update your logical view and give at least one example of what a plugin would actually do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming you have a centralized deployment with all stateful components storing their state in the same database, propose a strategy to split the monolith into at least two different microservices. Model the new logical/deployment view as well as the interfaces of each microservice you introduce.</p>
